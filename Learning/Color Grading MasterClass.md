| 3   | Curves            |                                                          |

| 8   | Globat Adjustment  |  The secret sauce to this is that you can make your image look like anything in the end, like if you want Teal and Orange look, you can create it right here without messing up anything that‚Äôs happening in previous nodes. You can also use LUTs and mess with it what it does, right here in this node. If you want a film look with a soft contrast, you can do it right here.                                                        |

#### Key Points

- It‚Äôs always **COLOR CORRECTION** before **COLOR GRADING**.
- *Color Correction* is a game of balance. You increase something here, you decrease something there, you decrease something there, you increase something here.
- *Primaries* is where most of the heavy-lifting happens.
- You can middle-click on the shot that you just finished grading and it‚Äôs gonna copy the nodes with all the information. If you just want to keep the nodes but not the grading data, go to: *Toolbar ‚Üí Color ‚Üí Reset ‚Üí Grades and Keep Nodes*
- Delivery
    - Always check *‚ÄúForce sizing to highest quality‚Äù* and *‚ÄúForce debayer‚Äù*.
    - Quality: Do not select auto, but *Restrict to 80,000Kb/s*
        - ***‚ÄúWhen you look at my YouTube videos, they look crisp and it does not seem like there is any compression applied to them, this does that. Because it retains a lot of the information.‚Äù*** - WQ
